BCToken Smart Contract

The BCToken Smart Contract is a basic Ethereum-based token contract implemented in Solidity. This README provides an overview of what this contract does and how to use it.
# Introduction

The BCToken contract is designed to create a simple ERC-20 compatible token on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes features such as token name, symbol, total supply initialization, token minting, and burning.
Features
Token Information

    name: A public string variable representing the name of the token.
    symbol: A public string variable representing the symbol of the token.
    totalSupply: A public uint256 variable representing the total supply of the token.
    owner: A public address variable representing the owner of the contract.

# Balances

    balances: A mapping that associates Ethereum addresses with their token balances. This allows users to track their token holdings.

# Constructor

    The constructor initializes the token with a name, symbol, and an initial supply.
    The initial supply is converted to the smallest unit (wei) using 18 decimals.

# Mint Function

    mint(address recipient, uint256 value): Allows the owner of the contract to mint new tokens and assign them to a specified recipient.
    Only the contract owner can call this function.
    The function checks that the value to mint is greater than 0.

# Burn Function

    burn(address target, uint256 value): Allows the owner of the contract to burn tokens from a specified target address.
    Only the contract owner can call this function.
    The function checks if the target address has a sufficient balance to burn.

# Getting Started

To deploy and interact with this smart contract, you can follow these steps:

    Deploy the contract to an Ethereum blockchain network using a development tool like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
    Initialize the contract with a name, symbol, and an initial supply.
    Interact with the contract using Ethereum wallet software or through a Dapp.

# Usage

You can use this smart contract as a starting point to create your own custom tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Modify the name, symbol, and initial supply to match your project's requirements. Additionally, you can extend this contract with more advanced features and functionality as needed.
